      <h1>Computer Science and Engineering</h1>

      The Majors Software Science and Web Science are formally embedded in the Bachelor program Computer Science and Engineering (in Dutch: Technische Informatica). Consequently, after completing one of these Majors, you will receive the Bachelor's degree certificate in Computer Science and Engineering.
      Program Objectives
      The overall objective of the Bachelor program is to train and educate young professionals who are able to progress into an appropriate Master’s program and/or are prepared to embark upon a professional career in the field of Software Science or Web Science.
      Students are therefore expected to: </br> </br>
      1.	acquire cognitive skills relating to computer science and engineering </br>
      2.	acquire practical capabilities and skills relating to software design (the Web Science major focuses on complex internet-based applications, while the Software
      Science major is more concerned with technical applications) </br>
      3.	acquire professional and generic academic skills </br>

      <h1>Curriculum</h1>

      A detailed program of the Software Science program is given in the following schedule, where each study component is represented by its code, name and timeslot (A-E). All components encompass 5 ECTS, except the final project 2IPE0 (10 ECTS).
      The major is constructed along important domains, in coherent packages called learning lines. The learning lines and their study components are listed below the schedule.

      <h1>Final Bachelor project</h1>

      2IPE0 Software/Web Engineering Project </br>
      The knowledge and skills learned in the previous years will be applied in an integrated way in the final DBL project, a large and complex software engineering project. </br>
      By conducting this project you demonstrate your ability to develop large non-trivial software in a group context. Each project has a real-life external customer, who needs a software system/prototype that has to be developed. As such, the project eminently fits the learning outcomes related to Software design.
      In order to get permission to take part, you need to have: </br>
      - at least 120 ECTS six weeks before the start of the project, and </br>
      - passed the 2IPD0 or 2IP25 Software engineering course </br>

      A project group consists of approximately 8 students. They work almost full-time on the project. Every group has its own project room in preferably MetaForum. </br>
      Each group has a project manager and a quality manager (Master students that follow 2IP45). Furthermore, each group has a technical advisor (staff member) to assist with technical questions and to review the technical documents. </br>
      The responsible teachers and the technical advisors judge the delivered documents and software of the group with regard to specific criteria that are published on the SEP study guide (see the course information for 2IPE0). This results in a group grade. </br>
      During the execution, peer assessment takes place in order to signal and deal with ‘freeriding’. The final peer assessments can influence the individual grade. </br>
      You also have to carry out a portfolio assignment on your own: you will reflect via a number of small individual exercises on the software engineering project and the Bachelor phase.
      This addresses professional skills like reflecting, and the ability to impart solutions to a lay public. You will also pitch yourself adressing to a panel of recruiters. The portfolio assignment is assessed separately. In order to pass the SEP component the portfolio needs to be graded as ’sufficient’. </br>
      In order to facilitate students who face a delay in their study progress, the project is also scheduled in Quarter 1, next to the regular instance in Quarter 4.

      <h1>Associate Master Programs</h1>

      The department offers three Master’s programs, all conducted in English, which follow on from the Bachelor’s program in Computer Science and Engineering. They are:
      Business Information Systems (BIS) </br>
      Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), incorporating the specialist Information Security Technology (IST) track and the Data Science in Engineering (DSE) track </br>
      Embedded Systems (ES) </br>
      Next to that, The Eindhoven University of Technology offers three tracks in the context of the European ICT Innovation program: </br>
      Data Science (EIT-DS) </br>
      Service Design and Engineering (EIT-SDE) </br>
      Embedded Systems (EIT-ES) </br>
      Those graduates that opt for a computer science teaching career in secondary education should consider to proceed in the Science Education and Communication (SEC) Master program. This program is conducted in Dutch only.
      A double degree program is also offered for SEC in combination with BIS and with CSE; these double degree programs amount up to 150 ECTS.
      For information about other Master programs into which you might progress, see www.doorstroommatrix.nl.
